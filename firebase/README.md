## Firebase Hosting/API

### Set-up

For development, we have to onboard our local systems onto Firebase.

We need `npm` so make sure to install Node.js!

Get get access to CLI `firebase` commands: `npm install -g firebase-tools`

Sign in to google: `firebase login`

At this moment we have access to any deployment and database accessing that we might want to do.
