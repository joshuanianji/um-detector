<sil> <sil> to view the competitors this is <sil> a guy called a(2) clock would come over <sil> from england when(3) it was the best trained memories <sil> [NOISE] and(2) i thank him <sil> and(2)

white sometimes doesn't(2) work <sil> and(2) what(2) its potential <sil> might be <sil> unopposed really interesting(2) people <sil> is the guy compete he <sil> <sil> became the(2) sick who had <sil> very possibly <sil> the worst <sil> memory <sil> in the world <sil> his memory was(2) so bad <sil> <sil> that(2) he didn't(3) even remember <sil> he had memory problem <sil> is amazing <sil> anew(2)

thousand twenty years(2) ago <sil> in <sil> latin <sil> in antiquity him and(2) later in the middle ages <sil> and(2) i've learned <sil> hold on to(2) really interesting(4) stuff <sil> [NOISE] one of the really interesting(2) thing that(2) i've learned <sil> is that once upon a time <sil> this <sil> idea <sil> of having a(2) train to(3) <sil> discipline the <sil> cultivated memory <sil> was(2) not nearly <sil> so cleanly and(2) <sil> if you'd seen capacity to(2) that <sil> once upon a time <sil> <sil> people invested(2) <sil> in their memory <sil> <sil> in <sil> laboriously <sil> <sil>

<sil> photography the computer this market <sil> they had made it aggressively easier and(2) easier <sil> for(2) us to <sil> external lines <sil> are memories <sil> for(2) us to send to(2) the(2) <sil> outsource <sil> is <sil> fundamental <sil> human <sil> capacity <sil> these technologies have made our(3) modern world possible <sil> that(2) it was a change of <sil> <sil> detainees at

was(2) the last places on(2) earth we still find people passionate about this idea <sil> of that(2) training that(2) discipline <sil> cultivated memory <sil> is that is totally <sil> thing you learned memory contacted back and i think you are(2) <sil> there conference(2) held all over the world my was(2) <sil> acting i want(2) to(3) know <sil> how <sil> do these guys <sil> do <sil> you use(2) crack <sil> a group of researchers at university college london <sil> brought appointed memory canteens into(2) the lab <sil> they want to(3) know <sil> do these guys have greater somehow structurally anatomically different(2) <sil> from the rest of ours(2) <sil> the(2) answer was <sil> no <sil> <sil> are they is smarter <sil> than the rest of us the(2) game about the(2) conduct of the(2) answer was(2) <sil> not really <sil> there was(2) however one(2) <sil> really(2) interesting(2) in telling difference between the brains <sil> of the memory canteens and control subject today we're(3) comparing them(2) to(3) <sil> make what these guys <sil> in f. m. r. i. machines <sil> standard rain falling or memorizing <sil> numbers in <sil> people's faces and it is no plates <sil> they found

<sil> [NOISE] is driven by a(2) kind of arms race <sil> where(2) every(2) year <sil> somebody(2) comes out with a(2) new(2) way <sil> to(2) remember more stop more quickly in the rest of the field asked(2) to(3) play catch up <sil> is my friend anything more <sil> free time <sil> world memory champion <sil> <sil> on(2) his <sil> death in front of him(2) or thirty(2) fifth(2) <sil> shuffled

off <sil> yet <sil> and(2) while there are <sil> <sil> almost always loved remembering(3) companies <sil> competition <sil> everything <sil> all of the techniques that(2) are(2) being used <sil> alternately come down to a(2) concept that(2) psychologist referred to and(2) <sil> elaborated in coding <sil> and(2) eighty well illustrated by nifty paradox <sil> known as(2) the(2) baker <sil> baker tear ducts which goes like this <sil> until two people <sil> to(2) remember the same word if i say <sil> <sil> see you <sil> remember <sil> that(2) there is a guy <sil> named baker <sil> <sil> that evening <sil> and(2) say you <sil> remember that(2) there is the guy <sil> who <sil> even a bigger <sil> look at <sil> i come back to(2) you at some point later on <sil> <sil> and(2) i say to(3) you remember <sil> that word but i told to a while back to(2) remember what it wants <sil> the person who stole his name and he's the <sil> speaker <sil> is less <sil> likely to(3) remember the theme

they need a(2) bigger <sil> i think actually(3) mean anything to(2) you <sil> [NOISE] it is <sil> entirely <sil> honest header <sil> from all the(2) other memories <sil> floating around(2) in your(2)

<sil> the(2) entire our(3) <sil> avoid going(2) on in the(2) <sil> memory contests <sil> in the(2) entire part of remembering(3) stuff better <sil> in everyday life <sil> is <sil> figuring out ways

<sil> date back <sil> twenty(2) five hundred(4) years(2) the ancient(2) greeks <sil> came to(2) be known as(2) the memory palace <sil> story <sil> behind its creation goes like this <sil> there is a
