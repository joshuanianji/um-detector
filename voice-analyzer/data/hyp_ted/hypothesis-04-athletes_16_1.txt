<sil> jesse owens the world record(2) in the one hundred(4) meters <sil> to(2) jesse owens been racing last year <sil> in the world championships of the one hundred(3) meters <sil> with jamaicans

out to(2) the front <sil> using bolster to(2) catch him(2) he's able passes(2) the roars committed initial your(2) beat as each man crosses the line <sil> <sil> that's the(2) entire finish of the ritz <sil> <sil> <sil> it'll be arise and(2) <sil> that burst beep was(2) using volpe <sil> that last week was(2) jesse owens <sil> listen to(3) it again <sil> <sil> <sil> we think of it like as not that

do that every(2) year <sil> on rare occasions a high school kid does it <sil> as in the(2) end of last(2) year <sil> one(2) thousand(2) three hundred(4) and fourteen men had run on(2) for(3) four minutes in a mile <sil> like jesse owens <sil> sir roger bannister(2) ran on soft(2) cinders <sil> that(2) stole four more energy than(2) his life in the sympathetic tracts of today <sil> <sil> so i consulted by mechanics experts <sil> to(2) find out how much slower rate is run on cinders and synthetic tracks <sil> in the consensus was(2) that(2) one(2) and a half percent slower <sil> <sil> to(3) view plywood and a half percent slowdown conversion <sil> to(2) every(2) man who ran his sub four minute(2) synthetic track <sil> this is what happens <sil> only five hundred(4) and thirty(2) year left <sil> if you look at that respect if you would intend you meant for(3) decades <sil> have joined us up for my outlets in sir roger bannister <sil> not <sil> five hundred thirty(2) is a lot more than(2) one(2) <sil> night and <sil> partly because(2) they're many more people treated entertaining(2) more intelligently <sil> [NOISE] even college kids are(2) professional their training compared to(2) sir roger bannister <sil> the train for(2) forty five minutes a time when(3) ditched gynecology lectures in med school <sil> and(2) i one(2) in nineteen oh four olympic marathon in three and half hours <sil> that that was(2) drinking rat poison in brandy <sil> or he ran along the course <sil> that was(2) his idea but performances and(2) syndrome <sil> <sil> <sil> clearly athletes of got more savvy about performs enhancing drugs as(2) well <sil> and(2) the(2) difference(2) in some sports is sometimes [NOISE] the technology has(2) made a difference(2) in all sports <sil> from faster skis to(3) later shoes <sil> take a look at the record(2) one(2) hundred(4) meter freestyle swam <sil> to(2) [NOISE] the record(2) is always(2) trending downward <sil> it punctuated by the(2) steep <sil> cliffs <sil> this first quit in nineteen fifty six is the(2) introduction of the foot turn <sil> rather than(2) stopping in turning around <sil> at the(2) tip somersault under the water and get(2) going right away in the(2) opposite direction <sil> the second class <sil> introduction of gunners <sil> on the side of the pool <sil> there was water to(2) slash off <sil> rather than(2) become turbulence impedes the swimmers is the(2) race <sil> is final cliff <sil> introduction of full body and(2) low friction swim suits <sil> brought sports technologies change the face of performance <sil> in nineteen seventy(2) two <sil> any marks set the record(2) the longest(2) distance cycled in one(2) hour(2) <sil> and(2) <sil> thirty miles three thousand(2) seven hundred(3) and(2) seventy(2) four feet <sil> <sil> at our(3) record(2) improved an improved <sil> as bicycles improved and(2) became(2) more aerodynamic <sil> on(2) wait till nineteen ninety six when(4) it was(2) set at thirty(2) five miles <sil> one thousand(2) five hundred(4) and(2) thirty(2) one(2) feet <sil> in the(2) five <sil> miles(2) <sil> farther <sil> than(2) any marks cycled in nineteen seventy two <sil> <sil> but then in two thousand <sil> the(2) international cycling(2) union <sil> decreed that(2) anyone wanting(2) to(3) hold that record(2) <sil> had to(2) do so with(2) essentially the same apartment <sil> that(2) any marks used in nineteen seventy two <sil> where is the record(2) stands at <sil> thirty miles(2) <sil> four thousand(2) six hundred(3) and fifty seven feet <sil> a(2) grand total of <sil> eight hundred(4) eighty three feet <sil> farther <sil> than(2) any marks cycle more than(2) four decades ago <sil> essentially the(2) entire improvement in his record(2) <sil> was(2) due to(3) technology <sil> stealth technology isn't the(2) only thing pushing athletes for <sil> all indeed we haven't(2) devolved into(2) a new species in a century <sil> the(2) gene pool with(2) the(2) keen competitive(2) sports most(2) certainly has changed <sil> [NOISE] in the(2) early half the twentieth(4) century <sil> physical education structures and coaches had the(2) idea that(2) the(2) <sil> average(3) body type <sil> was(2) the best for(3) all athletic endeavors <sil> medium height <sil> medium weight <sil> no matter the sport <sil> and(2) it showed an(2) ethics bodies <sil> in nineteen twenty's(2) <sil> the(2) average(3) elite high jumper inevitably chopper with the(2) same exact size <sil> with ideas that(2) the(2) away <sil> as sports scientists(3) and

took place assault sorting for(2) bodies that(2) <sil> it's certain sports <sil> athletes bodies became(2) more different(2) from one another <sil> <sil> today <sil> rather the(2) same size as(2) the(2) average(2) of the(2) high jumper <sil> the(2) ever to(3) be shot or just(2) one(2) half inches(2) taller <sil> than one(2) hundred(3) and(2) thirty pounds(2) heavier <sil> <sil> and(2) this happened to(2) route(2) the sports world <sil> in fact if you plot on a hike versus(2) mousetrap juan(2) de(3) point <sil> three to(2) two dozen sports in the first half the twentieth(4) century <sil> it looks like this <sil> is some dispersal <sil> it's kind groped around(2) that average(3) body type <sil> than an idea started to(2) go wait at the same time digital(2) technology <sil> first radio <sil> and(2) television in at <sil> the(2) millions or some cases(2) billions of people it take it <sil> to(2) consume police force performance <sil> the financial(3) incentive(2) to(3) fame and glory

if you caught a(2) whiff of the(2) same two dozen sports today <sil> it looks <sil> like this <sil> the(2) athletes bodies have gotten much more different(2) from one another <sil> <sil> and(2) because(2) this chart looks like the(2) charts to(2) show the(2) expanding universe <sil> with the(2) galaxy's flying away from another <sil> the scientists(3) to discover they call it the big bang of body types <sil> <sil> in sports or height is priced like basketball <sil> the tall ethics that taller <sil> in nineteen eighty three the national(2) basketball association <sil> sign the(2)

that(2) you know what american(2) man between the(2) ages(2) of twenty(2) and forty <sil> who's in the(2) seven feet tall <sil> this is seventeen percent chance he's in the(2) nba <sil> right now <sil> <sil> what(2) <sil> that is <sil> fine six on the seventh voters <sil> one(2) <sil> is in the(2) nba but right now <sil> and(2) it's not the(2) only way the nba players bodies are(2) unique
