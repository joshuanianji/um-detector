one(2) hundred(2) here more often(2) let's have 'em off the record(2) conversation <sil> turns out really means <sil> we want(2) nothing to do with(2) your(2) movie has(2) [SPEECH] <sil> been just(2) like that <sil> one(2) while line of [SPEECH] all of these companies suddenly disappeared(2) <sil> <sil> none of them(2) want(2) anything to(3) do with(2) this movie of the(2) aisle was(2) amazed <sil> they want(2) actually(2) nothing to it this project knowing that i was(2) one(2) way that(2) is what whole cause of the(2) idea but in keeping your(2) product down from as(2) many people as(2)
