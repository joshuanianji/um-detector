# Fluency / Um Detector

A voice analysis app built during [RevolutionUC 2021](https://revolutionuc.com/).

Fluency is a lightweight app that helps analyze your communication. At any point, a user can choose to start or stop recording their audio. The audio file will then be securely transferred over to our back-end servers to be analyzed directly using ML models without any work on the user-end. Once the analysis is completed, users can see statistics such as their speaking rate, amount of unnecessary pauses, and other valuable, and sometimes unexpected data.
