[SPEECH] <sil> to(3) lack of old law <sil> <sil> lack of structure <sil> in fact [SPEECH] mulch <sil> and that's why(2) <sil> that video <sil> feels a bit strange <sil> <sil> and(2) yet <sil> look around us <sil> [NOISE] <sil> what we see around us <sil> is staggering complexity <sil> to(3) bear in mind hopper estimates(2) that(2) the(2) <sil> u. old city alone there are(2) some ten billion

and(2) the convention center <sil> of the answer seems to(3) be <sil> the universe <sil> can create complexity <sil> bob with great difficulty <sil> [NOISE] in pockets their uphill wife played bridge live(2) coals <sil> goldilocks conditions <sil> not too hot <sil> not too cold <sil> just right for(2) the creation of complexity <sil> and(2) slightly more complex things appear [SPEECH] <sil> and(2) we have slightly more complex things <sil> you couldn't(2) get <sil> slightly more complex things and(2) in this way <sil> complexity bills <sil> stage by stage <sil> <sil> each stage <sil> is magical <sil> because(2) it creates the(2) impression of something <sil> ought to leave new(2) <sil> appearing <sil> almost out of nowhere in the universe <sil> where for(3) the(2) district of these moments

conditions <sil> get more stringent <sil> and(2) it's more difficult to(3) create complexity <sil> that <sil> we need <sil> is extremely complex creatures <sil> desperately(2) need to(3) know the

<sil> to(3) <sil> the decision to [SPEECH] surpass julio(2) <sil> and(2) then <sil> suddenly <sil> <sil> <sil> at <sil> the university is an(2) entire universe <sil> and(2) it cost(2) of those

<sil> you congealed <sil> <sil> perform last(2) [SPEECH] <sil> clocks <sil> beaupre true tones <sil> and(2) let tones of included electrodes on all of that happens a couple seconds [NOISE] now we move forward <sil> for a(2) hundred ninety thousand(2) deviates <sil> that's twice as(2) long as(2) humans to(3) be in on this planet <sil> and(2) out simple atoms appear out <sil> of hydrogen <sil> and(2) helium <sil> <sil> [NOISE] about what(2) it calls for(2) a moment <sil> three hundred(2) eighty thousand(2) years(2) off to(3) the origins of the(2) universe because(2) we actually(2) know quite a lot(2) <sil> about the universe <sil> of this that(2) <sil> [NOISE] we know what awful(2) [NOISE] that(2) it is extremely simple <sil> [NOISE] the(2) consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms <sil> and(2) they have no <sil> structure <sil> <sil> that the rehearsal halls whitmarsh <sil> [NOISE] <sil> but that's not completely true <sil> recent stockings by satellite such as(2) the <sil> w. map satellites <sil> have shown <sil> that(2) in fact are(2) <sil> just high in the(2) differences in the <sil> [SPEECH] ground [NOISE] would you see here [SPEECH] <sil> [NOISE] the blue areas <sil> or about a fire(2) hose into(2) the degrees <sil> cooler <sil> than(2) the red area it's a tiny difference(2) is <sil> that(2) it was(2) enough <sil> for(2) the(2) universe <sil> to(3) move on(2) to(3) the next(2) stage of building complexity and(2) this is how it works <sil> <sil> [NOISE] gravity <sil> is more powerful <sil> [NOISE] with a small <sil> stuff <sil> so when(2) <sil> you get sweaty dens areas <sil> gravity stocks compact(2) and clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms <sil> so we can(2) imagine the(2) early universe breaking out into open him clouds <sil> and(2) each cloud is compacted <sil> gravitated small <sil> how awful(2) as density increases(2) <sil> the temperature begins to(3) rise up the center of each clouds <sil> and an aversion to(3) reach clout temperature <sil> crosses the fresh cold temperature <sil> of ten million degrees [NOISE] <sil> protons stall to(3) fuse [NOISE] <sil> is a huge release of energy <sil> <sil> and(2) move [NOISE] <sil>

<sil> when(3) very large stalls thought <sil> they create temperature so high <sil> that(2) protons begin to(3) fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations [NOISE] to(3) for [SPEECH] all the(2) elements of the periodic table <sil> before(2) they knew(2) where the gold brain <sil> it was(2) forged in all seven of which <sil> were <sil> <sil> somehow that(2) moses chemically <sil> more complex <sil> and(2) <sil> <sil> chemically <sil> more complex universe <sil> it's possible to(3) make <sil> more funds [NOISE] and(2) what's not happening is around the owns all those <sil> young stalls <sil> all these elements combine(2) the(2) swirl around the <sil> energy of the stall still some around the(2) form <sil> of particles(2) that(2) forms a plentiful(2) little [NOISE] dots closely for <sil> rocks that(2) were asteroids in virtue reform(2) planets <sil> and(2) moons <sil> and that is how <sil> our(2) solar system was(2) formed <sil> for knockoff billion <sil> years(2) ago <sil> rocky planets like all [SPEECH] of <sil> a significantly <sil> more complex <sil> than(2) stops because(2) i'm(2) concerned i'm(2) much <sil> greater diversity(2) of materials <sil> to with cost before threshold of complexity <sil> now <sil> the going(2) gets tough for(2) <sil> [NOISE] the next(2) stage <sil> introduces entities that(2) significantly more fry dropped significantly more vulnerable <sil> to(2)

created(2) by chemistry <sil> we are huge packages of chemical <sil> is <sil> so <sil> chemistry is dominated by the(2) electromagnetic pulse operates of a small scale some gravity <sil> which explains why you are(2) not the smaller ones fossil plants <sil> [NOISE] only ideal <sil> conditions for(2) chemistry <sil> with goldilocks conditions well <sil> first you need energy <sil> but not

so little energy <sil> that(2) nasa's compton by <sil> what we want(2) is just the price of action plan as it turns out but just like the psychosis also <sil> but not too close(2) <sil> [NOISE] you also need great diversity(2) of chemical(2) elements <sil> and(2) <sil> you need <sil> liquid(2) <sil> such as(2) water <sil> water <sil> with new taxes(2) <sil> asses move boston troublesome faults
