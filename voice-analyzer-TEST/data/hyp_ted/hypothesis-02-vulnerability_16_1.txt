<s> how about that at the cavaliers a(2) gala at the(2) higher are called rate of five point you're thinking of that and(2) she caused is that <sil> i'm(2) really struggling(2) with(2) how to(2) write about you wanna will(2) fly here <sil> in <sil> iowa with the struggle and she said <sil> well i saw you speak and(2) i guy who <sil> can(2) recall(2) your(2) researcher i think i'm(2) afraid is likely researcher no one will(2) calm the(2) good(2) <sil> will(2) think you're boring around <sil> and who <sil> and(2) how they are(2) carrying(2) she said so <sil> that(2) if they don't(2) like it at your(2) clock is near your(2) storyteller so <sil> i think what i'll do is just(2) call us(2) storyteller <sil> and(2) of course the(2) <sil> academic <sil> insecure part of me was(2) like <sil> <sil> you can(2) recall(2) me why <sil> clinton had <sil> like us(2) storyteller and(2) i'd like <sil> <sil> to a <sil> white hat magic pixie <sil> hi <sil> hi hi hi <sil> i i now <sil> i really(2) think about this her second and(2) so <sil> on china called the my courage <sil> <sil> advise <sil> you know i am a storyteller <sil> and <sil> i'm a quality researcher like like stories that's what i do <sil> and(2) maybe stories are just(2) stay with(2) us all <sil> you know and(2) maybe i'm just <sil> a storyteller <sil> siphon you know why <sil> wanting(2) to(2) stammer researcher storyteller <sil> and(2) she ran <sil> <sil> [NOISE] it had an(2) the abstained has(2) <sil> got a researcher storyteller <sil> on an island it's hot seat today you were talking like being in <sil> perception in silence continuing tells a story and(2) not [NOISE] a piece of my research <sil> that's <sil> an(2) really expanded my perception <sil> on and(2) really actually(2) change the way the island and(2) [SPEECH] <sil> can(2) work a(2) parent <sil> ion and(2) this is where my story starts <sil> when i was(2) the(2) young researcher doctoral student <sil> my first year i had a research professor <sil> who <sil> said that <sil> here's the thing <sil> that(2) you cannot measure it it does not exist <sil> <sil> [NOISE] <sil> and(2) i come here to(2) sweet talk in the(2) house like <sil> really(2) is like absolutely <sil> [NOISE] <sil> c. have to(2) understand that i have <sil> a batches of social worker masters in so short of the(2) wreckage(2) in social work [NOISE] son and(2) her academic career [NOISE] was(2) surrounded by people [NOISE] <sil> who kind of believed in the(2) lights nasty <sil> <sil> lynette <sil> yeah i'm more the lights nasty <sil> clean it out dmitri(2) and i said and(2) did her bento box <sil> i uh-huh <sil> and(2) sell it to(2) think ahead <sil> now my way <sil> to(2) found a courier [NOISE] it takes me that really what the big things <sil> n. n.'s they're sort of leaned into(2) the discomfort <sil> of the work <sil> <sil> and(2) i'm like you have not discovered outside they had <sil> been said alfred and(2) get(2) all hayes <sil> that's life that was(2) my <sil> montserrat <sil> <sil> a <sil> salutary but i doubt that <sil> and(2) <sil> now i thought you why [NOISE] is it that(2) ripper may [NOISE] be good(2) i am(2) interested in finance the(2) topics [NOISE] but i want to(2) be able to(3) make them <sil> not <sil> they <sil> want to(2) <sil> understand and i want to(3) happen to(2) these things i know more important [NOISE] and(2) lady could out for(2) everyone to(2) see <sil> <sil> so where i started <sil> with(2) with(2) connection <sil> the(2) passes(2) <sil> by the time your(2) social worker for(2) <sil> ten years(2) when you realize <sil> [NOISE] is that <sil> connection is why we're(3) here <sil> it's like it's purpose and meaning to(2) our(3) lives(2) <sil> <sil> this is this is what it's all about doesn't(2) matter with you talk to(2) people who work in social justice(2) and know how <sil> and(2) abuse(2) in the glide to(3) what we narrow(2) [NOISE] <sil> is that connection <sil> here believe no connection <sil> there is <sil> <sil> your(2) while logically that's how we're(3) wired(2) is why(2) we're(3) here <sil> side by the(2) lead on this chart with(2) connection <sil> <sil> we now that <sil> that situation reagan(2) evaluation for(2) your(2) boss <sil> [NOISE] <sil> and(2) shit out recently singularly often and(2) one thing they tied him(2) an(2) opportunity for(2) growth <sil> and i'll [SPEECH] <sil> <sil> bet i'd like to(2) think about is that opportunity for(2) breath <sil> right <sil> well apparently this is the way my work for him <sil> as well <sil> because(2) <sil> when(3) you <sil> ask people about law(2) <sil> they tell you about heartbreak <sil> when(3) you ask people about [NOISE] <sil> the longing <sil> will tell you most excruciating experiences and(2) being excluded(2) <sil> when(4) you ask people about connection <sil> [NOISE] the stories they told me we're(3) about this connection <sil> <sil> [NOISE] is a very quickly really about six weeks into(2) this research iranians you this i mean to(2) <sil> hang <sil> [NOISE] that absolutely <sil> unraveled connection <sil> [NOISE] and(2) a way that i can(2) understand or(2) had never seen [NOISE] as i pull back at the research and plotting to(2) figure out what this as <sil> [NOISE] <sil> and(2) it turned out to(3) be <sil> shamed <sil> <sil> <sil> in shame is really easily understood at the <sil> spirit(2) of connection <sil> <sil> [NOISE] is there something about me <sil> that(2) other people know it mercy at <sil> [NOISE] that i won't <sil> be worthy of connection <sil> the things i can(2) tell you that it's universal <sil> we all have a feeling people downstairs shame have no capacity for(2) human [NOISE] empathy or(2) inaction <sil> no one wants to(3) talk about it and(2) alicia talk about the maury how that <sil> <sil> [NOISE] <sil> <sil> what(2) [SPEECH] <sil> i'm your(2) pension <sil> this shame this <sil> i'm not good enough <sil> which we all know that feeling i'm not going to(2) nafta not <sil> an average(3) that beautiful not smart enough <sil> from the [SPEECH] math <sil> on the thing that(2) underpinned s. flies <sil> excruciating vulnerability <sil> [NOISE] this idea <sil> [NOISE] <sil> [SPEECH] of <sil> where(2) for(2) connection to(3) happen <sil> we have to allow ourselves(2) to(3) piece the(2) <sil> <sil> really(2) see <sil> [NOISE] <sil> and(2) you know how i feel about vulnerability and(2) hate vulnerability in south park not as(2) is my chance <sil> to(2) beat it back with(2) my measuring stick <sil> on going(2) and(2) <sil> i managed(2) to(2) get(2) the stuff out on us than(2) a(2) year <sil> on italy deconstruction <sil> on understandable italy works [NOISE] and(2) i can outsmart <sil> the hell is ready <sil> and(2) i was(2) really excited(2) <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> as you know as(2) i can(2) turn out well [SPEECH] pat and i you know that <sil> it's like it's like a(2) lot on shamed <sil> and iran everyone else's time <sil> that(2) he is i can(2) tell you that(2) boils down to(2) <sil> end this may be one as important things that never learned <sil> in the decade of doing this research <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> my one years turned into <sil> six years(2) <sil> thousands of stories <sil> hundreds of wong interviews in focus(2) groups [NOISE] at one point you for sending journal pages(2) in funding their stories [NOISE] on <sil> thousands(2) of pieces(2) of data <sil> <sil> on <sil> and(2) six years <sil> and(2) i haven't(2) got a handle on it <sil> i can understand this is what shane is this is how it works <sil> <sil> for(2) redbook <sil> giant poster theory <sil> [NOISE] that(2) something was(2) not okay <sil> on <sil> what(2) it was is that it by abruptly took the(2) people i interviewed <sil> and(2) in five minutes if people <sil> <sil> who <sil> really(2) <sil> have the sense of worthiness that's what this comes down to(2) <sil> a sense of working yes <sil> [NOISE] <sil> they have a strong sense of love and belonging <sil> and(2) folks who struggle for it <sil> and folks you're(2) always <sil> wondering if they're good enough <sil> [NOISE] he was(2) only one(2) variable that(2) separated the people who have a strong sense of [SPEECH] [SPEECH] belonging <sil> [NOISE] and(2) the people who <sil> really struggle for it [NOISE] and(2) that was(2) that(2) people who have a strong sense of walking along a(2) <sil> believed their worthy of love and boldly <sil> that <sil> they believe there were a(2) <sil> [NOISE] <sil> antony the hard part <sil> [SPEECH] of [SPEECH] <sil> the one thing that(2) keeps us out of connection as our(3) <sil> fear that we're(3) not worthy of connections <sil> [NOISE] <sil> with(2) something that personally(3) professionally(2) i felt like i needed to(3) <sil> understand that are(2) <sil> [NOISE] <sil> so when i did and(2) <sil> they is <sil> i ate the all of the(2) energy is worse are worthy passwords are people living that way [NOISE] <sil> and(2) just <sil> looked at <sil> that's [NOISE] <sil> <sil> what do these people have in common <sil> and(2) i have to(3) have a slight <sil> office supply addiction that <sil> it's another top(2) hat <sil> by having the whenever <sil> i'm in a yellow folder has sharply <sil> and(2) <sil> i was(2) like when i recall(2) this research in the <sil> first word they came to(3) my mind work wholehearted <sil> he served and(2) wholehearted people <sil> living purvis deep sense of boardinghouse i read the top of the mill <sil> older <sil> [NOISE] <sil> after looking at today in <sil> fact why(2) did it first thing is very fortunate(2) for day <sil> [NOISE] very content(2) that day announces wetland baffled the(2) synergies pull the stories told in <sil> advance [NOISE] with(2) the <sil> with(2) the theme of the pattern <sil> of my husband left town begets son <sil> and(2) yet i know is going(2) to(3) come and(2) jackson pollock crazy tanker i'd just like <sil> my unit(2) in going and(2) have just(2) been a researcher mad <sil> <sil> and(2) said here's what i felt <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> what they have in common <sil> with(2) the sense of courage [NOISE] <sil> <sil> when(2) a <sil> separate courage and bravery for(3) you for(3) men and(2) [NOISE] <sil> courage(2) the(2) original <sil> definition courage(2) when(2) it first came as(2) the(2) english(2) language(2) it's on the line worker <sil> the(2) hearts [NOISE] and(2) your(2) job at the mission was(2) to(3) tell the story <sil> who you are with(2) your(2) whole heart <sil> into(2) these folks have a(2) <sil> very simply the courage(2) to(3) be in perfect <sil> [NOISE] <sil> they had the(2) compassion <sil> to(2) be kind and south first <sil> and(2) then to(2) others <sil> because(2) as it turns out <sil> we can purchase compassion with(2) other people and(2) we can <sil> treat ourselves(2) kindly <sil> and(2) the last was(2) they had connection <sil> and(2) is the hard part <sil> <sil> as a result of authenticity <sil> they were willing to(3) let go of who they thought they should be <sil> <sil> and(2) are to(2) be who they were <sil> witches <sil> you how to <sil> absolutely do that for(2) connection <sil> <sil> <sil> the(2) <sil> other thing that(2) they have in common <sil> was(2) that's <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> a(2) fully embrace(2) vulnerability <sil> <sil> may <sil> believe it <sil> <sil> that what made them vulnerable <sil> they beautiful <sil> <sil> they did talk about <sil> homer believe being comfortable <sil> nor did they really talk about it being excruciating <sil> as i've heard earlier in the shade interfering(2) <sil> they just talked about it being necessary <sil> <sil> they talked about the willingness <sil> to(2) say i love you first <sil> <sil> the willingness to <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> do something or other no guarantees <sil> [NOISE] the willingness <sil> to breeze through waiting for(2) the doctor call after you may regret <sil> <sil> they're willing to invest in relationship <sil> that may or(2) may not work out [NOISE] <sil> they thought this was(2) fundamental(2) <sil> [NOISE] <sil> i personally(2) thought it was(2) <sil> the trail <sil> <sil> <sil> of <sil> [SPEECH] i could not read(2) i pledge allegiance to(2) research <sil> for(2) our(3) job here the definition of research is to(2) control control and(2) forget is that a(2) phenomenon for(2) the reason for(2) the experts explicit reason to control and(2) forget <sil> and(2) out my [SPEECH] theory <sil> healed my mission to(2) control a project(2) [NOISE] had turned up the(2) answer <sil> that the way the wind(2) is the vulnerability <sil> <sil> and(2) is not controlling predicting <sil> this lets you <sil> <sil> a little break down high <sil> which(2) actually(3) <sil> with(2) more like that <sil> that i <sil> <sil> that(2) at led to(2) a(2) <sil> iconic down a third of <sil> all those years(2) awaiting <sil> the(2) sewing falconer the breakdown but i assure you of the breakdown <sil> and(2) i had a mighty away <sil> and(2) get on with(2) their pet cemetery(2) something <sil> you know who you are <sil> when(3) you call your(2) friends and

people like that and i hibernate <sil> it with(2) a(2) yearlong street right and <sil> there was(2) the flight path <sil> will(2) really pushed by push back <sil> i lost <sil> <sil> on the <sil> night that probably(2) one(2) my life back <sil> [NOISE] and(2) said that i went back into(2) their research and(2) next couple of years(2) <sil> really(2) trying(2) to(2) <sil> understand what they the wholehearted [NOISE] <sil> [SPEECH] with(2) the choices(2) they were making <sil> and(2) what what <sil> what <sil> will be dealing with(2) vulnerabilities <sil> <sil> high <sil> <sil> do we struggle with(2) its image and(2) i alone in struggling(2) vulnerability <sil> <sil> <sil> now <sil> so <sil> this is what i learned to(3) <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil> we now know <sil> vulnerability <sil> when(2) we're(3) waiting for(2) the call <sil> this an unprecedented out on twitter and(2) on base but if that's how would you define vulnerability what magical vulnerable <sil> and(2) within(2) an(2) hour(2) and a half hour(2) had a(2) hundred(3) and fifty respondents <sil> <sil> [NOISE] i like it i want to(3) know you know what without their [NOISE] <sil> <sil> <sil> <sil>

[NOISE] <sil> we live(2) in a vulnerable world <sil> [SPEECH] and <sil> one(2) of the ways we deal with(2) it is we known vulnerability <sil> <sil> and(2) i think there's an address <sil> if not the(2) only reason is that as(2) as(2) the night they did their kids are(2) at a(2) huge caucus(2) [NOISE] we are <sil> the best thing that <sil> <sil> obese <sil> and(2) defend <sil> and(2) medicated until <sil> cohort in us(2) history <sil> <sil> that(2) ha long as an(2) island us from the research <sil> <sil> that you cannot selectively down <sil> an(2) ocean <sil> <sil> [NOISE] you can <sil> say <sil> here's the fact that <sil> cures vulnerability years(2) grief your(2) shame here sphere here's disappointed(2) <sil> i don't wanna feel the(2) it's <sil> [NOISE] <sil> on the house a couple

when(3) we now [SPEECH] <sil> that [SPEECH] is <sil> we now enjoy(2) <sil> we young gratitude <sil> renowned happiness <sil> and(2) then <sil> we <sil> are <sil> miserable(2) <sil> and(2) we're

<sil> one of the things <sil> <sil> that i think that(2) we need to(2) think about the(2) air is <sil> why how we now [SPEECH] <sil> <sil> [NOISE] but it doesn't(2) just have to(2) be addiction <sil> <sil> to <sil> the(2) other thing we do is we make everything that(2) concerns are(2) in <sil> the <sil> <sil> religion(2) <sil> has gone from i believe in fate and history <sil> to(3) certainty <sil> <sil> that right you're wrong <sil> shot back <sil> at that <sil> jasper <sil> and more free we are the more bomber we are [NOISE] the more <sil> afraid we are <sil> this is what politics looks likes
